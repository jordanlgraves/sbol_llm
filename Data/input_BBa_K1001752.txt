OUTPUT:

This circuit contains a Red Flourescent Protein (https://synbiohub.org/public/igem/BBa_E1010/1) and Ribosome Binding Site (https://synbiohub.org/public/igem/BBa_B0034/1) behind the modified Lambda Prm Promoter (https://synbiohub.org/public/igem/BBa_I12006/1).
This modified Lambda Promoter is induced by the lamda cl repressor (https://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_C0051) instead of repressed by it.
When induced, the RFP is expressed. This allows the inducible Lamda Prm promoter to control the expression of an RFP.
