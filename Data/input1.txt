Input2:
Coding region for the LacI protein with an LVA degradation tail and without an RBS. LacI binds to the pLac regulator BBa_R0010 and PLlac01 hybrid regulator BBa_R0011 and inhibits transcription. IPTG (Isopropylthiogalactoside) binds to LacI and inhibits its operation, therefore promoting transcription. A rapid degredation tail (LVA) has been added to improve the High to Low performance of this part.


Output:
The [lactose repressor protein LacI] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/947505) is a DNA-binding transcription factor that represses transcription of the operon involved in transport and catabolism of [lactose] (https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D007787). Hudson JM., et al. 199038. The importance of architecture for the DNA-binding protein in the DNA repression loop has been determined using high-resolution in vivo protein-mapping techniques with heterologous [Nhp6A] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/852036) from [Saccharomyces cerevisiae] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=4932) and the [Escherichia coli lac promoter] (https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D020745). Becker NA., et al. 201546. Based on molecular dynamics simulation, it was determined that the [hinge-helix linker region (HH)] (https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D000849) of [LacI] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/947505) is extremely flexible in solution, but a high concentration of salt can help kinetically trap the HH. Seckfort D., et al. 201935. A computational analysis suggested that the hinge region of [LacI] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/947505) is important for the nonspecific binding to DNA, for which electrostatic interactions among the [LacI protein] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/947505), DNA, and salt ions are crucial [27008630] (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27008630). The hinge region, which is extremely flexible in solution, is important for the transition from disorder to order when the dimer [LacI repressor] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/947505) binds to the correct DNA sequence. The presence of the DNA binding domain proximal to the HH and salt make the ordered conformation more favorable even without DNA present. Seckfort D., et al. 202021. Using a method adapted to high-resolution mapping of protein binding to DNA in living cells, binding of three different DNA loop sizes with the [Nhp6A architectural protein] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/852036) was detected for a single sequence in the lac promoter. Becker NA., et al. 201546. On the other hand, in an in vivo single-molecule assay, the sliding process for the [LacI transcription factor] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/947505) was determined. [LacI] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/947505) slides [45 Â± 10 bp] (https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11883) on chromosomal DNA, and this can be obstructed by other DNA-bound proteins near the operator. [LacI] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/947505) binds to the [O1, O2, and O3 operators] (https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D020745) upstream of the [lacZ promoter] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/947505). Lewis M., et al. 199618. It slides over its natural [lacO1 operator] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/947505) several times before binding (>90% repressor frequency), suggesting a trade-off between a rapid search on nonspecific sequences and fast binding at the specific sequence. Hammar P., et al. 201241. A 91-bp [LacI-mediated negatively supercoiled DNA loop] (https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D000849) mimics the DNA loop between the [O1 and O3 operators] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/947505) in the [lacZp1 promoter] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/947505). Fulcrand G., et al. 201645.
