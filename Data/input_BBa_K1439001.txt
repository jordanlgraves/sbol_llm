        BBa_J04450
            SO:0000804 - A region that is engineered.
            https://synbiohub.org/public/igem/BBa_J04450/1)
            Gene: Highly engineered mutant of red fluorescent protein from Discosoma striata (coral)

        OriTRP4
            SO_0000724 - A region of a DNA molecule where transfer is initiated during the process of conjugation or mobilization.

OUTPUT:

This circuit contains the reporter gene, RFP (https://synbiohub.org/public/igem/BBa_J04450/1) combined with the origin of transfer for the RP4-plasmid nic region, OriTRP4)(https://synbiohub.org/public/igem/BBa_K1439000/1). 
OriTRP4 was derived from the RP4 plasmid (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=2503).
